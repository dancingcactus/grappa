Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Can I use ``grappa`` with any testing framework?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, you can. ``grappa`` is testing framework agnostic.
In fact, you don't even need to use a testing framework at all to use it.


Can I extend ``grappa`` with other assertion operators?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Of course you can. ``grappa`` is an extensible modular testing library.
