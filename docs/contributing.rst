============

``grappa`` is actively developed and improved. As in any other open source project, community help is always welcome.

These are some of the tasks where community help is highly appreciated:

- Add more assertion operators.
- Improve error reporting with better messages.
- Improve documentation and examples.
- Improve test coverage.
- Implement pending features (see `Github issues`_).
- Create or improve plugins (http, server...)
- Write a post introducing ``grappa``, along with real use cases.
- Potential core refactors and improvements.
